The meticulous data extraction process from Kayak was crucial for obtaining a dataset essential for testing the regression model's effectiveness across diverse flight scenarios. This dataset acts as a foundation, ensuring the model's adaptability and accuracy. Our dedication to utilizing data-driven insights to empower travelers remains unwavering.

The scraping methodology involved user interaction to input specific routes and dates. It commenced by prompting users to input origin and destination cities for desired flight routes, allowing multiple routes to be entered until completion was indicated. Subsequently, the system prompted users to input start and end dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format to define the desired flight data collection duration. The scraping process, meticulously architected to target specific routes and date ranges, utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to navigate Kayak's web interface accurately. User-defined parameters enabled the extraction of relevant flight information for targeted analysis and future reference.

The scraping implementation involved a systematic approach using Python's versatile toolset, leveraging Selenium's automation capabilities and BeautifulSoup's parsing prowess for data extraction. NumPy facilitated effective data processing, while tqdm ensured comprehensive progress tracking during the extraction process. The systematic loop through defined routes and dates facilitated data extraction, organizing flight information into structured dataframes based on airlines, sources, destinations, durations, stops, prices, and dates. The collected information for each route was stored as separate CSV files for focused analysis and easy access.

The outcome of our scraping efforts was a comprehensive dataset spanning from February 1, 2024, to April 30, 2024, covering 12 specific routes. These routes included significant flight paths such as RUH => NYC, NYC => PAR, and PAR => SVO, among others. This meticulously curated dataset serves as the foundational bedrock essential for training and refining our predictive models, paving the way for precise flight price predictions.

#### Features Analysis and Importance

In correlation Matrix, we found that flight duration moderately correlates with the total number of stops, and a strong link exists between actual price and average price, indicating how these tend to vary together. These findings have significantly contributed to our understanding of flight patterns and pricing behavior.
However, our analysis didn't stop there. We delved deeper to determine which features play a crucial role in predicting flight prices. By employing the Extra Trees Regressor, we uncovered a key revelation. The 'Average Price' stood out as the most influential factor in predicting flight prices, exerting a considerable impact on determining the final ticket cost.
To sum up, our correlation analysis and feature importance assessments have pinpointed the pivotal role of the 'Average Price' feature in forecasting flight costs. This pivotal insight is instrumental in refining our predictive models, revolutionizing how we comprehend and estimate flight expenses.

### Data Modeling and Model Selection

Our dataset was split into three segments: 60% for Training, 20% for Validation, and 20% for Testing.
We delved into various regression models, exploring Polynomial regression up to 5 degrees. While higher degrees showed improvement, there was a risk of overfitting.
Amidst our evaluations, the standout performer was the Random Forest Regression. Its robustness and exceptional predictive accuracy surpassed other models.
To enhance our models, we applied Feature Scaling techniques. However, despite our efforts, we didn't observe a significant performance boost.
After an extensive analysis of regression models, the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the frontrunner. Its favorable performance metrics deemed it the optimal choice for our predictive model.

#### The final selected model is the random forest regression model with:

### Results

Our Random Forest model underwent a crucial retraining phase, incorporating both training and validation datasets to boost its predictive capabilities.
Following this, we implemented Hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search CV. This method rigorously explored various hyperparameter combinations through 5-fold cross-validation, aiming to minimize mean squared error.
However, our findings revealed that the model's performance did not notably improve. This suggests that the initial model configuration may already be quite close to its optimal settings.
In conclusion, our RandomForestRegressor model exhibited remarkable predictive performance. As shown, The final model displayed outstanding accuracy, forecasting ticket prices within an approximate range of $61.87 on the test set.
