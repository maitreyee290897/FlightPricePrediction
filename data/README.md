# Flight Dataset Details

Contained within this directory is a collection of meticulously scraped data sourced from Kayak. The dataset spans the timeframe from February 1st, 2024, to April 30th, 2024. It encompasses a comprehensive record of 12 distinct flight routes, facilitating an extensive analysis of air travel patterns and pricing dynamics.

The recorded flight routes within this dataset are as follows:

1. **RUH => NYC**
2. **RUH => SVO**
3. **RUH => PAR**
4. **NYC => RUH**
5. **NYC => SVO**
6. **NYC => PAR**
7. **SVO => PAR**
8. **SVO => RUH**
9. **SVO => NYC**
10. **PAR => NYC**
11. **PAR => RUH**
12. **PAR => SVO**

These specific routes were carefully selected to capture a diverse range of travel destinations and originating points, thereby enabling a comprehensive analysis of flight pricing trends and patterns.

The dataset's primary purpose revolved around training the models within the project. Utilizing this rich collection of flight data, various predictive models were trained to enhance the understanding of pricing dynamics and facilitate accurate predictions for flight ticket costs across these specific routes.

This dataset serves as the foundational backbone for model development and serves as a crucial resource for insights into airfare fluctuations and trends across the specified routes.
